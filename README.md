Alerta Release 3.3
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/satterly/alerta.png)](https://travis-ci.org/satterly/alerta)

The alerta monitoring tool was developed with the following aims in mind:

*   distributed and de-coupled so that it is **SCALABLE**
*   minimal **CONFIGURATION** that easily accepts alerts from any source
*   quick at-a-glance **VISUALISATION** with drill-down to detail

Requirements
------------

The only requirement is MongoDB. Everything else is optional.

- MongoDB

Optional
--------

A messaging transport that supports [AMQP][2] is required for notification to alert subscribers. It is recommended to use RabbitMQ, but Redis and even MongoDB have been tested and shown to work.

- RabbitMQ
- Redis
- MongoDB

Note: The default setting uses MongoDB so that no additional configuration is required.

Installation
------------

To install and configure on Debian/Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install mongodb-server
```

To use RabbitMQ as the message transport instead of the default MongoDB install the additional packages:

```
$ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
```

To install from git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/guardian/alerta.git alerta
$ cd alerta
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

Configuration
-------------

The configuration file format has changed in Release 3.2 to a python `settings.py` file. To override default settings in this file create `/etc/alertad.conf` or set `ALERTA_SVR_CONF_FILE` environment variable to `~/.alertad.conf` or `~/.config/alertad` or something similar. Make sure to to export the environment variable before running the server, like so:

```
export ALERTA_SVR_CONF_FILE=~/.alertad.conf
```

The default configuration should work. If you are using RabbitMQ change the `AMQP_URL` setting to:

```
AMQP_URL = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//'
```

Running
-------

To start the alerta server simply run:

```
$ alertad
```

To send some test alerts run:

```
$ contrib/examples/create-alerts.sh
```

To view alerts in a terminal run:

```
$ alerta query
```

To view alerts in a web console install the [Alerta Web UI][3]
